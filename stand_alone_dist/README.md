### Stand Alone Distribution

**WARNING**: Use this as a last resort. We make no guarantees that the files here are the most up-to-date content.

If for reasons beyond your control, you cannot install the plotly package via pip (e.g., you need to install on a machine without and internet connection), you may use the zipped archive here as follows:

Here we assume you're familiar with command-line tools and that you've got pip installed.

#### Unix-y Folks, do this:
```bash
curl -O https://github.com/plotly/python-api/raw/tarball-link/stand_alone_dist/dist.zip
unzip dist.zip
cd dist
ls | xargs pip -I install
```
